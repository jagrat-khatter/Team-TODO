# Simple ToDo Application

## Overview

This is a basic ToDo application that allows users to sign up, create ToDos, and view their ToDos. It consists of a backend (Node.js with Express) and a frontend.  The backend uses MongoDB as the database.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and authenticate using JWT.
* **ToDo Management:** Users can create ToDos and view only their own ToDos.

## How It's Built

* **Backend:** The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles user authentication and ToDo data management.  JWT is used for authentication.
* **Database:** MongoDB is used as the database to store user information and ToDo items.
* **Frontend:** The frontend provides a simple user interface with a signup page and a dashboard. Users can sign up, and after successful signup, they are redirected to a dashboard where they can add and view their ToDos.
